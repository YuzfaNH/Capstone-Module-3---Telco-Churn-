Telco Customer Churn Prediction
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry using machine learning techniques. Customer churn is a critical issue for companies, as acquiring new customers is often more expensive than retaining existing ones. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that identifies customers who are likely to churn, enabling the company to take proactive steps to retain them.

Business Problem
The churn rate for the company, Telco, stands at 26.7%, meaning that approximately one in four customers leaves the service within a given period. This high churn rate can significantly impact the company's revenue and profitability. Therefore, the main objectives of this project are:

Identify High-Risk Customers: Utilize predictive modeling to accurately identify customers most likely to churn.
Reduce Churn Rate: Implement targeted retention strategies based on the model's predictions to decrease the overall churn rate.
Data Understanding
Before building predictive models, the project involves a thorough understanding of the dataset provided by Telco. The dataset includes customer profiles, service usage, and other relevant factors that might influence churn. Key steps in data understanding include:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Assessing the distribution of variables, handling missing values, and understanding relationships between features.
Data Preprocessing: Converting categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Methodology
The project employs several machine learning algorithms to build and evaluate predictive models. These include:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Gradient Boosting Classifier
Model evaluation is based on key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The project also explores hyperparameter tuning using techniques like GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.

Evaluation Metrics
Type 1 Error (False Positive): Retention efforts wasted on customers who are not at risk of churn.
Type 2 Error (False Negative): Failing to retain high-risk customers, resulting in lost revenue.
False negatives are considered more detrimental as they directly impact revenue by losing potentially high-value customers.

Results
The project outcomes will focus on:

The best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
Insights gained from feature importance analysis.
Recommendations for deploying the model in a business setting.
Conclusion
The final model aims to provide a measurable reduction in the churn rate by enabling the company to focus retention efforts on the most at-risk customers. The impact of implementing this model on business processes should be observable through improved customer retention and optimized resource allocation.

Limitations and Future Work
While the model provides valuable insights, it is crucial to acknowledge limitations related to data quality, model assumptions, and time constraints. Future work could involve exploring additional features, employing more advanced modeling techniques, or implementing real-time prediction systems.
